  <h2>Export/Import</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      ES modules or ECMAScript modules, are the standard way to modularize code in JavaScript.
      <br />
      ES modules allow us to export and import things from one module to another.
      It increases the reusability of code. 
      <br />
      It is imperative to note, that it requires the use of type="module" in the script tag in the HTML file
      for applications running in the browser.
      <br />
      For Node.js, it's your package.json file that needs tweaking.
      <br />
      Below is an example of a package.json file with the "type": "module".
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      {
        "type": "module",
        "dependencies": {
          "express": "^4.19.1",
          "nodemon": "^3.1.0"
        }
      }
      </code></pre>

  <h2>Type module vs. commonjs</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      CommonJS and ECMAScript modules (ES6) are two different module systems in Node.js.
      <br />
      <br />
      CommonJS is the native module system for Node.js, and is what we worked with in the beginning of this semester.
      <br />
      Its syntax for importing  modules is:
    </p>
      <pre><code>
        const express = require('express');
      </code></pre>
    <p> 
      To use ES6 modules, you need to set "type": "module" in your package.json file.
      <br />
      ES6 modules use the following syntax, among others, for importing modules:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      import express from "express";
      import { readPage, renderPage } from "./templatingEngine.js";
      import * as name from "module-name";
    </code></pre>
  </div>

  <h2>Static in Node.js</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Serving static files in Node.js can be done using the express.static middleware.
      <br />
      The express.static middleware is a built-in function in express.
      <br />
      The result of the code block below, is that express will serve static files from the directory given.
      (usually a folder named "public")
      <br />
      this also means that only files in the public folder can be accessed by the client.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      app.use(express.static("public"));
    </code></pre>

  <h2>Backend vs Frontend fetching</h2>
  <div>
    
      <p>
        When it comes to fetching data, there are pros and cons to both backend and frontend approaches.
      </p>
      <h4 class="frontback-h4">Backend fetching</h4>
            <ul>
        <li>Pros:</li>
        <br />
        <ul class="proscons">
          <li>Backend fetching allows you to keep sensitive data and logic secure on the server.</li>
          <li>You have more control over the data flow and can implement complex business logic.</li>
          <li>possible to Optimize data retrieval by caching and handling server-side rendering.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li>Cons:</li>
        <ul class="proscons">
          <li>Can introduce additional latency as the client needs to make requests to the server.</li>
          <li>Requires setting up server-side endpoints and handling authentication.</li>
          <li>Load on the server can get high, potentially affecting scalability.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="frontback-h4">Frontend fetching</h4>
      
      <ul class="proscons">
        <li>Pros:</li>
        <ul class="proscons">
          <li>Can reduce latency by fetching without the server as middle link</li>
          <li>Frontend fetching enables a decoupled architecture where the frontend and backend can be developed independently.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <li>Cons:</li>
        <ul class="proscons">
          <li>Security: Frontend fetching exposes data and logic to the client-side if not taken care of.</li>
          <li>Fetching large amounts of data on the frontend can impact load times and consume more client-side resources.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

  <h2>Structuring frontend</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      In regards of structuring our HTML, 
      this is the folder structure we have ended up with.
    </p>
    <img id="structure-img" src="../../assets/images/structure-html.png" alt="picture of html structure using express">
    <p>
      With footer and header divided into separate files, and the main content in the pages folder,
      we have a clean and organized structure.
      using a more modular approach, we can easily add new pages and reuse components.
      <br />
      <br />
      I went a step further than what we've been taught,
      and decided to store all my external links in a separate file.
      This way, I can easily update all my links in one place.
      <img id="external-links-img" src="../../assets/images/external-links.png" alt="picture of external links in a separate file">
