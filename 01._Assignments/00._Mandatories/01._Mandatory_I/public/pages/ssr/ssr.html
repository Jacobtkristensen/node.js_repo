  <h2>Client(CSR) vs. Server-side Rendering(SSR)</h2>
  <div>
    <h3>Load time</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>SSR</strong>
      <br />
      Initial load time is faster because the server sends the fully rendered page to the client.
      On the other hand, on new page requests, the server has to render the page again.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>CSR</strong>
      <br />
      Initial load time is slower than SSR, as the client has to wait for parsing and rendering of the page.

    </p>
    <h3>Resources</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>SSR</strong>
      <br />
      The server has to render the page on every new request, which requires more resources.
      This also means that the client spends less resources on rendering the page.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>CSR</strong>
      <br />
      Server's only job is to serve the application, and handle API requests. The client has to do the 
      rendering, which can be resource intensive.

    </p>
    <h3>SEO</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>SSR</strong>
      <br />
      Better SEO, as the server sends the fully rendered page to the client.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>CSR</strong>
      <br />
      Worse SEO, as SE rely on fully loaded HTML pages.
    </p>
    <h3>CORS</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>SSR</strong>
      <br />
      No CORS issues, as the server sends the fully rendered page to the client.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>CSR</strong>
      <br />
      CORS issues can happen, as the client might have to make requests to different servers.

  <h2>File reading</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      In Node.js, we can read files using the <code>fs</code> module. 
      <br />
      Below is an example of our template engine that reads the components needed for the page.
      It then concatenates the header, page, and footer to render the page with the correct tab title and styles.
        </p>
    <pre><code>
      import fs from "fs";

      export function readPage(path) {
        return fs.readFileSync(path).toString();
      }
      
      const footer = fs.readFileSync("./public/components/footer/footer.html").toString();
      
      export function renderPage(page, config={}) {
          const header = fs.readFileSync("./public/components/header/header.html").toString();
          return header.replace("$TAB_TITLE$", config.tabTitle ?? "DogInder")
                      .replace("$STYLE_IMPORTS$", config.STYLE_IMPORTS ?? "")
        + page 
        + footer;
      }
    </code></pre>
  </div>

  <h2>Nodemon ext</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      we learned that nodemon wasn't reloading the server when we were editing the HTML & CSS files.
      <br />
      Nodemon can be configured to watch for changes in specific file extensions. 
    </p>
      <pre><code>
        nodemon --ext html,js,json,css
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      The above will add the following to the <code>nodemon.json</code> file.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      {
        "ext": "html,js,json,css"
    }
    </code></pre>
