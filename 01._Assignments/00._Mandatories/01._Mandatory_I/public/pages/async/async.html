  <h2>Linting</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Linting is a great tool to help keep your code clean and consistent. It can help catch errors, and enforces coding standards.
      <br />
      There are several linters available. Personally i have used Prettier, configured, for a while for formatting, and have tried ESLint once. 
      ESLint gave me a wall of syntax errors, which was a bit overwhelming. 
      I believe ESLint is a great Javascript linter, but I have yet to fully embrace it.

  <h2>Debugging</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      One of the most important abilities a developer can have is the ability to debug code. There are several approaches
      to debugging, but the simplest method is to use console.log. 
      <br />
      Whenever data is not being properly displayed, or not passed at all, adding console.log statements can help with
      tracking at what point the data is lost. 
      <br />
      This is also possible to do in a browser, by opening dev tools and use the breakpoints to pause the code at a certain points of execution.
      <br />
      This, i feel like can become a bit tedious, stepping in and out of functions, pausing and resuming the code. Therefor, 
      i prefer to use console.logs to track the data flow. 
      <br />
      <br />
      That being said, the intergrated terminal and the browser, both give us runtime errors providing us with a stack trace
      of the error, what file it is in, and what line of code the error is on.

  <h2>Asynchronous code in JS</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Javascript being single-threaded, means that it can only execute one task at a time.
      This is an issue when we're dealing with tasks that might have a delay to them, like fetching data from an API.
      This is where asynchronous code comes in.
      <br />
      <br />
      Asynchronous code allows us to "wait" for a task to finish, and then execute said task when its ready.
      This is done by using callbacks, promises, or async/await.(there's more, but this was what came to mind when thinking about it.)
      <br />
      <br />
      Below is an example of how to fetch data from an API using async/await.
      <br />
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      //part of a post request to chatGPT API, sending a list of offers and getting a recipe in return
      async function fetchRecipeAdmin(selectedOffers) {
        const recipeDescriptions = selectedOffers.map((offer) => offer[7]);
        const data = await fetch(
          URL,
          makeOptions("POST", recipeDescriptions, true)
        ).then((r) => handleHttpErrors(r));
      }
    </code></pre>

  <h2>Routers (Express)</h2>
  <p>
    we built our own routing in its own file, exporting it in the process. This is a part of the structure of our project.
    in conjuction with our templateEngine, and readPages, we have a solid foundation for serving our server-side rendered pages.
    <br>
    The modular approach to building my app, makes it easier to maintain and to expand new features.
    Below is a snippet part of the pagesRouter.js and its use in my app.js</p> 
    <pre><code>
    import { Router} from "express";
    import { homepagePage,
    introductionPage,
    firstserverPage,
    htmlfilesPage,
    timePage,
    exportImportPage,
    ssrPage,
    asyncPage
    } from "../util/readPages.js";

    const router = Router();


    router.get("/", (req, res) => {
      res.send(homepagePage);
    });
    router.get("/introduction", (req, res) => {
      res.send(introductionPage);
    });

    export default router;
    </code></pre>
    <pre><code>
    import express from "express";

    const app = express();
      
    app.use(express.static("public"));
      
      
    import pagesRouter from "./routers/pagesRouter.js"
    app.use(pagesRouter);
      
    const PORT = 8080;
    app.listen(PORT, () => console.log("Server is running on port", PORT));
    </code></pre>
