  <h2>Git</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code and collaborate with others, making it
      easy to see what changes have been made, and by who.
      <br />
      It is especially useful when working on a project with other developers, as it allows for easy merging of changes and makes
      it possible to resolve potential conflicts.
      <br />
      Reviewing each other's code is also a part of the process, which results in higher quality code, and ensures that it's not
      only you, who knows what your part of the project is responsible for.
      <br />
      <br />
      Below are some of the most commonly used git commands
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      git init
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      Is used to instantiate a git repository in your project directory. This creates a .git folder in the root of the working
      directory, if one doesn't exist already. This command only needs to be run once per project. <br /><br />
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      git add -A
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      This command will stage ALL changes in the entire repository, whereas the &nbsp;<code> git add . </code> will only stage
      files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

      <br /><br />
      it is also possible to stage a single file by using<code> git add [file] </code> <br /><br />
      <code>git add -A</code> is more convenient, especially when working with files in multiple directories.
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        git commit -m "your-message"
        </code></pre>
    <p>
      This command will commit the staged files to the repository. The -m flag is used to include a message with the commit. This
      is especially useful when looking back at previous commits to understand the changes that were made.
      <br />
      <br />
      It is also good practice to describe whatever changes have been made, so that other developers have a clear understanding of
      the changes made.
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      git push origin main
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      This command will push the committed changes to the main branch of the remote repository. You can replace main with the name
      of the branch you're working on.

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    git status
  </code></pre>
    <p>
      Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area. It lists all the files that have been modified, are
      untracked, or are staged for commit.
      <br />
      This is good to use when you want to see an overview of the changes that have been made, and to see which files are staged,
      and which are not.
      <br /><br />
    </p>
  </div>
  <pre><code>
    git checkout [branch-name]
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Switches to the specified branch. When adding <code>-b</code> flag as in <code>git checkout -b [branch-name]</code>, it will
    create a new branch and immediately switch to it. This command is used to navigate between different development branches and
    for creating new branches to work on. <br /><br />
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    git merge [branch-name]
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    Merges the specified branch into your current branch.
    <br />
    This allows you to combine the changes from another branch with your current branch.
    <br /><br />
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    git pull origin [branch-name]
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    pulls and merges changes from the remote branch to your local branch. This updates your current branch with the latest commits
    from the remote repository.
    <br />
    It's essential for keeping your local repository up-to-date with changes from others, or when working on different pc's.
    <br /><br />

  <h2>Data types</h2>
  <div>
    <h3>Strings</h3>
    <p>
      Template literals are a way to concatenate strings in JS. They are denoted by backticks (`) and can contain variables using
      the <code>${}</code> syntax.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    const firstName = "Anders";
    const lastName = "Latif";
  
    const fullName = `My first name is ${firstName} and my last name is ${lastName}`
    console.log(fullName)
    // Result: My first name is Anders and my last name is Latif
    </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      Here we try to add a string and a number together.
      <br />
      To combine the string <code>"2023"</code> and the number <code>1</code>, we can use the <code>parseInt()</code> function to
      convert the string to a number before adding them together.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    const year = "2023";
    const increment = 1;
    
    let newYear = parseInt(year) + increment;
      
    console.log(newYear);
    // Result: 2024
    </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Here we try to add two strings together.
      <br />
      To combine the strings <code>"1.10"</code> and <code>"2.30"</code>, we can use the <code>parseFloat()</code> function to
      convert the strings to numbers before adding them together.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    const numberOne = "1.10";
    const numberTwo = "2.30";

    const sum = parseFloat(numberOne) + parseFloat(numberTwo);
    console.log(sum);
    // Result: 3.4
    </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>same as above, but we use the <code>toFixed()</code> method, to ensure that we get a number with two decimals.</p>
    <pre><code>
    const anotherNumberOne = "1.10";
    const anotherNumberTwo = "2.30";
      
    let sum2 = parseFloat(anotherNumberOne) + parseFloat(anotherNumberTwo);
    sum2 = sum2.toFixed(2);      
    console.log(sum2);
    // Result: 3.40
    </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Here we try to add three numbers together and then calculate the average.
      <br />
      We again use <code>toFixed()</code> to ensure that we get a number with five decimals.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    const one = 10;
    const two = 45;
    const three = 98;

    let sum3 = (one + two + three) / 3;
    sum3 = sum3.toFixed(5);
    console.log(sum3);
    // Result: 51.00000
    </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Characters</h3>
    <p>
      Here we try to extract a character from a string using <code>string[number]</code> and the <code>substring()</code> method.
      <br />
      substring takes two arguments, the start index and the end index.
    </p>
    <pre><code>      
    const letters = "abc";
    let char = letters[2];
    let char2 = letters.substring(2, 3);
    console.log(char);
    console.log(char2);
    // Both resulting in: c
    </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Here we try to replace a character in a string using the <code>replace()</code> method.
      <br />
      First argument is the character to be replaced, and the second argument is the character to replace it with.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    const fact = "You are learning javascript!";

    let factCapitalized = fact.replace("j", "J");
    console.log(factCapitalized);
    // Result: You are learning Javascript!
      </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Here we access the value of a property in an object, but first we reassign the value to a new variable, making it easily
      accessible.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    const myObject = { message: "Hello, earthling! I bring peace." };

    let message = myObject.message;
    console.log(message); 
    // Result: Hello, earthling! I bring peace.
    </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Here we define an object and its properties.</p>
    <pre><code>
    const me = {
      name: "Jacob",
      age: 30      
    };
    
    console.log(me); 
    // Result: { name: 'Jacob', age: 30 }
    </code></pre>
  </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Here we add a new key value pair to an object. 
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    const stackOverflow = {};

    stackOverflow.isAllowed = true;
    console.log(stackOverflow.isAllowed); 
    // Result: true
    </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Here we remove a property from an object and assign a new one.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    const thisSong = { description: "The best song in the world." };

    delete thisSong.description;
    thisSong.about = "Just a tribute.";
    console.log(thisSong); 
    // Result: { about: 'Just a tribute.' }
    </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Arrays</h3>
    <p>
      Here we access an element in an array by its index.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    const letters = ["a", "b", "c"];
    const letter = letters[1];
    console.log(letter); 
    // Result: b
    </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Here we add elements to the end of an array.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    const friends = [];
    friends.push("Jacob", "Poul", "Karlo");
    console.log(friends); 
    // Result: ['Jacob', 'Poul', 'Karlo']
    </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      We can also add elements using the <code>splice()</code> method.
      <br />
      The first argument is the index where the new elements should be added, the second argument is the number of elements to be
      removed, and the remaining arguments are the elements to be added.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    const diet = ["tomato", "cucumber", "rocket"];
    diet.splice(2, 0, "hamburger", "soda", "burger");
    console.log(diet); 
    // Result: ['tomato', 'cucumber', 'hamburger', 'soda', 'burger', 'rocket']
    </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Here we remove the last element from an array using the <code>pop()</code> method.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    const diet2 = ["tomato", "cucumber", "hamburger", "soda", "burger", "rocket"];
    diet2.pop();
    console.log(diet2);       
    // Result: ['tomato', 'cucumber', 'hamburger', 'soda', 'burger']      
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Here we copy the above array.
    </p>
      <pre><code>
      const dinnerTray = diet2.slice();
      console.log(dinnerTray); 
      // Result: ['tomato', 'cucumber', 'hamburger', 'soda', 'burger']
      </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Here we iterate over an array and log every second element.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    const lettersExpanded = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h"];
    for (let i = 1; i < lettersExpanded.length; i += 2) {
    console.log(lettersExpanded[i]);
    }
    // Result: b, d, f, h
    </code></pre>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Loop through array and print numbers greater than 6, or below 0 and add the rest to a new array.
      <br />
      Then print the new array.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    const numbers = [5, 3, 2, 7, 11, 12, 0, -20, 6];
    const discardedNumbers = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
      if (numbers[i] > 6 || numbers[i] < 0) {
        console.log(numbers[i]);
      }
      else {
      discardedNumbers.push(numbers[i]);
      }
    }
    console.log(discardedNumbers);
    // Result: 7, 11, 12, -20 
    // Result: [5, 3, 2, 6]
    </code></pre>

  <h2>Type coercion</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Type coercion in Javascript is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another. Usually it's when you perform operations on values of different types,
      such as adding a string and a number together.
      <br />
      Understanding this concept is important, as it can lead to bugs and unexpected behavior.
      <br />
      <br />
      Example of type coercion and strict equality operator in JavaScript
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    2 == "2" -> true 
    2 === "2" -> false //checks for both value and type
    '100' + 10 = '10010'
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      In the first example, the double equals operator coerces the string "2" to a number before comparing the two values, which results in true.
      <br />
      In the second example, the strict equality operator does not perform type coercion, so the comparison returns false.
      <br />
      In the third example, the plus operator concatenates the string "100" and the number 10, resulting in the string "10010".

  <h2>Node.js</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Node.js is an open-source Javascript runtime environment that allows developers to run Javascript code outside of a web browser.
      <br />
      <br />
      I among others have used it last semester to run javascript files. 
      <br />
      To run a JavaScript file using Node.js, navigate to the directory where the file is located and execute the command<code> node [filename].js</code> 
      This will run the JavaScript code in the file.    </p>
